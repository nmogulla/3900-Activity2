# 3900-Activity2
This website was built as part of the ISQA 3900 - Web Application Development Activity 2 Assignment.

To develop the web page I have used HTML, External CSS.

The website basically has 3 pages i.e., HOME, ABOUT ME and MY UNIVERSITY.

You can navigate across the pages by using the navigation bar at the top right.

In About Me I have described about myself and added a hyperlink to my linkedIn profile at the bottom.

The My University page redirects to the University of Nebraska Omaha About page.
