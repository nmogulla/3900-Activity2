# 3900-Activity2
This website was built as part of the ISQA 3900 - Web Application Development Activity 2 Assignment.

To develop the web page I have used HTML, External CSS.

The website basically has 3 pages i.e., HOME, ABOUT ME and MY UNIVERSITY.

**Steps for using the website**

Clone the repo and then open the index.html file which is presemt in the home directory in a browser.

You can navigate across the pages by using the navigation bar at the top right.

In About Me I have described about myself and added a hyperlink to my linkedIn profile at the bottom.

The My University page redirects to the University of Nebraska Omaha About page.

I have published the webiste to github pages by pushing the changes to this repo https://github.com/nmogulla-uno/nmogulla.github.io.
